# Getting Started

## Overview

The *Jitterbit Harmony API Integration Platform* (Harmony) is
Jitterbit's modern, multi-tenant, born-in-the-cloud API integration
platform that connects Software as a Service (SaaS), on-premises, cloud,
and legacy applications.

Harmony is powered by Jitterbit's iPaaS capabilities and consists of
these components:

-   **Harmony Agents (Cloud Agents and Private Agents):** Harmony Agents
    do the work at runtime, connecting to various endpoint systems,
    transforming data, etc. You can use Cloud Agents (serverless agents)
    and/or Private Agents (formerly known as Local Agents) with one of
    these deployment models:
    -   **Cloud (Serverless, Full Cloud, Multi-Tenant):** On the
        Jitterbit Harmony cloud, where the system and scale is
        completely managed by Jitterbit.
    -   **Private (On-Premises, Local):** Either an on-premises server
        or in a public/private cloud, where the system is self-hosted
        and/or self-managed.
    -   **Hybrid:** In a hybrid mode, where selected portions of the
        system are self-managed and the remainder is fully managed by
        Jitterbit.
-   **Harmony API Gateway:** Provides security, throttling, and
    validation of any and every incoming API that users publish via
    Jitterbit.
-   **Harmony Backend Services:** Include a notification engine, remote
    Private Agent management, and a number of other backend systems and
    services.
-   **Harmony Design Repository:** A secure and encrypted, centralized
    collection of the integration projects.
-   **Harmony Messaging Services:** Facilitate communication among
    various Harmony components, providing a reliable method for routing,
    tracking, and integration retry mechanisms.
-   **Harmony Transaction Logs:** Provide easy debugging capabilities
    and can be stored for a configurable period of time either locally
    or on the cloud.
