[//]: # (Finding My Region)

## Introduction

<span class="conf-macro output-inline" hasbody="true"
macro-name="multiexcerpt">Jitterbit uses servers in separate regions for
NA (North America), EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and
Africa/Asia/Australia), and APAC (Asia-Pacific). The region is tied to a
Harmony [organization](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Organizations) rather than a
specific user. A user can be part of multiple organizations, as long as
the organizations are all in the same region.</span>


## <span style="color: rgb(85,46,155);">Find Your Region</span>

To find the region tied to a specific organization, log in to
the <a href="https://login.jitterbit.com/" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">Harmony Portal</a>. After you log in, you will find the
web address URL has changed to include the region associated with the
organization you are accessing, and begins with either "`apps.``na`",
"`apps.emea`", or "`apps.apac`".

-   **NA:** If the URL begins with "`apps.`**`na`**", then your
    organization is located in North America (NA).
-   **EMEA:** If the URL begins with "`apps.emea`", then your
    organization is located in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and
    Africa/Asia/Australia).
-   **APAC:** If the URL begins with "`apps.apac`", then your
    organization is located in APAC (Asia-Pacific).

If you have access to multiple organizations, you can switch between
them using the organization dropdown in the menu bar. The URL shown in
the address bar will reflect the region associated with the current
organization you are accessing.
