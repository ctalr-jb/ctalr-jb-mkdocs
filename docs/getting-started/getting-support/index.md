## Production-down Situations

We know how worrisome a production-down situation is, and we're here to
give you top priority if that should occur.

If you have a production-down situation, file a support case as
described on this page, and put *Production Down* in the subject of
your case.

Be sure to fully describe the situation in the body of your message and
include your contact information, the Jitterbit product you are using,
and your endpoints. Include anything you think would help us
troubleshoot the problem.

Our system is designed to recognize the specific phrase *Production
Down* in the subject and will respond appropriately by alerting us of
your request with an urgent priority assigned.


## Submitting a Support Case Using the Jitterbit Support Portal

<span style="color: rgb(23,43,77);text-decoration: none;">We recommend
contacting Jitterbit Support directly by submitting a support
case</span>. Our <a
href="https://community.jitterbit.com/s/login/?startURL=%2Fs%2Fsupport"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Jitterbit Support Portal</a> is
accessed
through <a href="https://community.jitterbit.com/s/" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">Jitterbit Community</a>.

The Support Portal is a separate and private section of Jitterbit
Community.

Once you have logged in to Jitterbit Community, the <a
href="https://community.jitterbit.com/s/login/?startURL=%2Fs%2Fsupport"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Support Portal</a> becomes
available. In the Support Portal, you can create new cases and view your
case history.

See [Using the Jitterbit Support
Portal](https://success.jitterbit.com/download/DOC/Using+the+Jitterbit+Support+Portal) for details.


## <span id="GettingSupport-submitting-a-support-case-using-email" class="confluence-anchor-link conf-macro output-inline" hasbody="false" macro-name="anchor"> </span>Submitting a Support Case Using Email

Though we recommend submitting support cases by opening a support case
through the <a
href="https://community.jitterbit.com/s/login/?startURL=%2Fs%2Fsupport"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Jitterbit Support Portal</a>, we
also provide the option to open a case using email.

Email <a href="mailto:support@jitterbit.com" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">support@jitterbit.com</a> with a brief subject line and
this information:

-   Screenshots, if applicable (hide any information you do not want to
    be seen, such as passwords or other credentials).

-   Error messages and stack traces if available. If using Cloud Studio
    and you receive a "Something unexpected happened" error, please
    include the unique error ID provided with the message.

-   Description of the issue. For example, if you are reporting a
    problem please include:

    -   What you were doing when the problem occurred, what you expected
        to happen, and what actually happened.

    -   The exported project (JSON file or Jitterpak) and, if possible
        or appropriate, sample files, logs, and error messages that
        demonstrate the problem. These may be required for us to
        reproduce the issue, and are very helpful if you think the issue
        is a bug. Our support team will get back to you if we need
        additional information.


## Checking Case Status and Escalating Cases

As your case progresses, you will receive emails to notify you of the
case status changes. You can also log in to the <a
href="https://community.jitterbit.com/s/login/?startURL=%2Fs%2Fsupport"
class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Jitterbit Support Portal</a> to
check on the case status.

Please be sure to set up yourself and your team members as "Authorized
Contacts" with your Jitterbit Sales Representative or Customer Success
Manager. This assures the fastest possible support experience.  

If you are an Enterprise-level customer, you can call your emergency
hotline to escalate support cases, if needed. Contact your Customer
Success Manager if you are unsure as to your emergency hotline.
