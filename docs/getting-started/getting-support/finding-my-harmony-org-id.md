[//]: # (Finding My Harmony Organization ID)

## Introduction

Each Harmony organization has an associated organization ID. We
recommend providing your organization ID when you [contact
support](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Using+the+Jitterbit+Support+Portal).


## Selected Organization

To find your Harmony organization ID, first log in to
the <a href="https://login.jitterbit.com/" class="external-link"
rel="nofollow">Harmony Portal</a>. After you have logged in, the
selected organization is displayed in the top right, to the left of
the **Help** menu. The organization name is listed first, followed by
the organization ID in parentheses. In this example, the organization
name is JB Example Inc., and the organization ID is 500131:

If you are a member of multiple organizations, you can use the dropdown

member. Click any organization to switch the selected organization
within the Harmony Portal:
