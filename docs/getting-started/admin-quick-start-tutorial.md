### Welcome to Jitterbit!

By default, the wizard is tailored for using Cloud Studio, our web-based
project design application. You can use a link that appears at the
bottom of this screen to switch between wizard steps for [Design
Studio](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Design+Studio) and [Cloud
Studio](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/CS/Cloud+Studio). The steps are similar and are covered
here for both project design applications.

### Set the Stage for Success

Select a deployment configuration that is appropriate for your
organization:

-   **Run Integrations in the Cloud:** Select this option to create a
    new environment associated with one of Jitterbit Harmony's two
    [Cloud Agent Groups](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Cloud+Agent+Groups).
-   **Run Integrations On-Premises:** Select this option to create a new
    environment associated with a newly created Private Agent Group
    containing at least one [Private Agent](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Private+Agents)
    that must then be downloaded, installed, and configured.

For considerations about using Cloud Agents vs. Private Agents, see <a
href="https://success.jitterbit.com/display/doc/Jitterbit+Security+and+Architecture+White+Paper#JitterbitSecurityandArchitectureWhitePaper-HarmonySecurityTopologiesHarmonySecurityTopologies"
rel="nofollow">Harmony Security Topologies</a> within the [Jitterbit
Security and Architecture White
Paper](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Jitterbit+Security+and+Architecture+White+Paper).

### Set Up Your First Environment

You must set up at least one environment to start creating projects in
Harmony.

Fill out these fields to configure your first environment:

-   **Name Your Environment:** Enter a name for your new environment
    (for example, Development, Test, or Production).

-   **API URL Prefix:** Enter a prefix that will become part your API
    URL (managed from the [API Manager](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/API+Manager)). The
    **API URL Prefix** will replace `&lt;API-URL-Prefix&gt;` in this example
    format:

    ```
    https://&lt;OrgName&ID&gt;.jitterbit.org/&lt;API-URL-Prefix&gt;/API-Version/API-Public-Name
    ```

-   **Cloud Agent Group:** Present only for the option **Run
    Integrations in the Cloud**, use the dropdown to select the [Cloud
    Agent Groups](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Cloud+Agent+Groups) you want to associate
    with the environment:

    -   **Jitterbit Production Cloud Agent Group:** This group offers
        the most stable version of the Cloud Agent, recommended for
        production environments.
    -   **Jitterbit Sandbox Cloud Agent Group:** This version offers
        early access to the next release of the Cloud Agent, recommended
        for non-production environments.

-   **Description:** Enter a description of your environment.

For detailed information about each configurable field, as well as to
configure additional environments, see
[Environments](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Environments).

For best practices on working with environments in Jitterbit, watch
the [Environments Tech Talk](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Environments+Tech+Talk).

### Set Up Agent Group and Agent Name

<div
class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information conf-macro output-block"
hasbody="true" macro-name="info">

<span
class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon">
</span>

<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">

**NOTE:** This step is present only for the **Run Integrations
On-Premises** configuration.

</div>

</div>

Private Agent Groups allow you to set up Private Agents as on-premises
runtime servers that execute your integrations, as well as group agents
together so that each acts consistently. These groups operate as a
highly available and scalable elastic runtime engine.

Fill out these fields to set up your first Private Agent Group and
Private Agent:

-   **Name Your First Agent Group:** Enter a name for your new Private
    Agent Group that will service the environment you just set up.

-   **Name Your First Agent:** Enter a name for your new Private Agent
    to be set up within the Private Agent Group.

-   **Description:** Enter a description that will be used for your new
    Private Agent Group.

-   **Enable Cloud Logging:** Cloud logging is enabled by default,
    meaning logged data is saved in the Harmony cloud. When cloud
    logging is enabled, operation logs, including detailed log messages
    from both Cloud Agents and Private Agents, are retained for 30 days
    by Jitterbit Harmony. When cloud logging is enabled, log messages
    are also accessible on the
    [Activities](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Activities) page in the **Messages** tab.
    If desired, clear the checkbox to disable cloud logging. When cloud
    logging is disabled, a link will be displayed in the **Messages**
    tab that allows the logging information to be viewed from the agent
    itself.

    <div
    class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-warning conf-macro output-block"
    hasbody="true" macro-name="warning">

    <span
    class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-error confluence-information-macro-icon">
    </span>
    <div class="confluence-information-macro-body">

    **WARNING:** Disabling cloud logging will not prevent operation
    input and output data from being logged to the Harmony cloud if
    operation debug logging is enabled at the operation level. For more
    information see [Operation Debug
    Logging](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Operation+Debug+Logging).

    </div>

    </div>

For detailed information about each configurable field for Private
Agents and Private Agent Groups, see [Agents](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Agents).

### Download and Install

After your environment is set up and associated with an Agent Group,
download and install the associated Harmony applications depending on
your needs.

If you selected the option **Run Integrations On-Premises**, you will
need to download and install at least one [Private
Agent](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Private+Agents) to run integrations. This download
is not provided if you selected **Run Integrations in the Cloud**, in
which case you will be using one of Jitterbit's [Cloud Agent
Groups](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Cloud+Agent+Groups) to run integrations.

If you are using the wizard steps for [Design
Studio](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Design+Studio), you will also need to download and
install Design Studio, Jitterbit's desktop application for project
design. This download is not provided if you are using the wizard steps
for [Cloud Studio](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/CS/Cloud+Studio), our next-generation
project designer featuring a modern and collaborative user experience
with a cloud-based UI.

Additional information on prerequisites, downloading, and installing
Design Studio and Private Agents is available within [System
Requirements](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/System+Requirements).

### You Are Ready!

You are now ready to get started designing your first project.
