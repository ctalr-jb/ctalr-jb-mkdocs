## What are ISO 27001 and ISO 27017?

ISO 27001 is an international standard that covers planning, design,
implementation, monitoring, testing, and improving a security management
system. This important security standard details the requirements and
best practices which uses regular risk assessments in order to manage
company and customer information assets.

ISO 27017 builds upon the existing security controls in ISO 27001. It
deals with the protection of information in cloud services. ISO 27017
provides guidance and recommendations on implementing cloud-specific
information security controls. This standard provides advice and
guidance for cloud customers and providers.


## About the ISO Audit and Assessment

The ISO audit and assessment provides you assurance around:

-   implementation of an information security management system for
    Jitterbit Harmony development, operations, and support;

-   controls that we have put in place to protect personally
    identifiable information (PII); and

-   implementation of an in-depth, company-wide information security
    risk management program.

The ISO audit and assessment – along with the <span

Applicability (SOA) – provide information about the controls that
Jitterbit implemented in support of our security and privacy
commitments.
