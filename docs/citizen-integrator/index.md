## The Demands of the Digital Age Require a Smarter Approach to Integration

Apps transformed the way we live. Now they’re transforming the way we
work.

You and your team are dealing with more data, applications and devices
than ever. The pressure is on you to quickly build connections between
all of these things — but traditional integration solutions simply
cannot scale out fast enough to keep up with today’s business demands.

Most integration technologies are designed to speak to apps, not users.
Unless you speak SOA, ESB, SOAP or REST, you have to rely on the
technical folks who do. And if you are one of the technical folks,
everything has fallen to you, and you don’t have time to keep up.

Introducing Citizen Integrator, by Jitterbit. It’s designed for
marketers who need to automate and report on campaigns. For IT directors
who need to offer self-service integration to other departments quickly
and securely. For salespeople who want to deliver quotes faster and with
the right product information.

Jitterbit is designed for you to get connected today.

    Citizen Integrator recipes to multiple environments and customers.
    You can even build your own recipes and publish them to the world —
    or keep them private if you prefer.

    comes with an ever-growing library of recipes that connect a variety
    of applications using standard fields and best practices design
    patterns. You can have common integrations up and running in
