# Jitterbit Harmony Management Console

## Overview

The *Jitterbit Harmony Management Console* (Management Console),
accessible through the [Jitterbit Harmony
Portal](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Jitterbit+Harmony+Portal), provides administrators
the ability to manage integration projects for an entire Jitterbit
Harmony organization. It provides the ability to define the integration
project lifecycle specific to the organization, along with the tools to
enforce the security and access control rights for each defined stage of
the lifecycle (e.g. development, testing, production).

The Management Console communicates securely with Jitterbit HarmonyÂ over
HTTPS. All users must be authenticated with Jitterbit Harmony.

The management functions provided to the user are further controlled by
access control rights defined for each environment. Any user accessing
the Management Console will be able to see only the data the user has
been given permission to see. Access controls are applied to any and all
functions, including searching for operation information, running
operations, and viewing logs.
