# Jitterbit Harmony API Manager

## Overview

*Jitterbit Harmony API Manager *(API Manager) is Jitterbit's API
management web interface where you can create and publish
developer-friendly APIs and perform full API lifecycle management
tasks. You can expose any system as a secure, managed, real-time API
that can be called and consumed by any other app. You can access API
Manager through the [Jitterbit Harmony
Portal](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Jitterbit+Harmony+Portal).

## Prerequisites

To access API Manager, you must be a member of a Jitterbit Harmony
organization with a subscription to API Manager and have the appropriate
organization permissions and environment access levels as described
in [Jitterbit Harmony Permissions and
Access](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Jitterbit+Harmony+Permissions+and+Access).

As API Manager is accessed through the Harmony Portal, it does not
require any additional hardware or software installation. These major
browsers are supported:

-   Chrome

-   Firefox

-   Safari (macOS only)

In order to communicate with the Harmony cloud and access the Harmony
Portal, JavaScript needs to be enabled and outbound port 443 (HTTPS)
needs to be open. This port is normally allowed by corporate server
firewalls.

**NOTE:** If using [Private Agents](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/DOC/Private+Agents), note
that Linux Private Agents can accept a higher API load (more requests
per minute) than Windows Private Agents on identical machines.
