[//]: # (Project Pane)

## Overview

The project pane is the part of the Cloud Studio UI where you can view
and manage workflows and project components.

To access the project pane, first [open a
project](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/CS/Project+Creation+and+Configuration). In an open
project, the project pane is displayed on the left of the project
designer:

<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img

class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource"
data-image-src="https://docs-source.jitterbit.com/cs/project/project-designer_project-pane_annotated_pp.png" /></span>

The project pane contains two tabs: **Workflows** and **Components**.
These tabs are described on the pages included in this topic:

-   **[Project Pane Workflows
    Tab](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/CS/Project+Pane+Workflows+Tab)**  
    The **Workflows** tab displays a hierarchically organized view of an
    open project's workflows, operations, and components used within
    each operation.
    
-   **[Project Pane Components
    Tab](https://success.jitterbit.com/display/CS/Project+Pane+Components+Tab)**  
    The **Components** tab displays all of an open project's components
    grouped by category.
