[//]: # (Cloud Studio FAQ)

## Introduction

This page covers frequently asked questions about [Jitterbit Harmony Cloud Studio](/display/CS/Cloud+Studio), the
web-based version of Jitterbit's project design application.


## Who can use Cloud Studio?

All Jitterbit Harmony subscribers have access to Cloud Studio.

When you log in to the [Jitterbit Harmony Portal](/display/DOC/Jitterbit+Harmony+Portal), click the Cloud Studio app
card on the left to begin designing projects directly in your browser:

## As a new Cloud Studio user, where should I start?

Sign up for the [introductory course](/display/DOC/Getting+Training#GettingTraining-cloud-studio) offered through
Jitterbit University, our online learning management platform. Information about signing up is available at [Getting
Training](/display/DOC/Getting+Training).

We also have a [Cloud Studio Quick Start Guide](/display/CS/Cloud+Studio+Quick+Start+Guide) to get you up and
running quickly, and a dedicated section of [Cloud Studio](/display/CS/Cloud+Studio) documentation for detailed
reference.

In addition, [Jitterbit Marketplace](/display/DOC/Marketplace) provides hundreds of pre-built projects by offering
[Cloud Studio Integration Recipes](/display/CS/Cloud+Studio+Integration+Recipes) and [Cloud Studio Process
Templates](/display/CS/Cloud+Studio+Process+Templates), with more continually being added. To get started with an
existing recipe or template, see [Starting a Recipe or Template
Project](/display/DOC/Starting+a+Recipe+or+Template+Project).


## Where can I get help?

We provide the same level of support for Cloud Studio as we do for our other Harmony products. Learn more at
[Getting Support](/display/DOC/Getting+Support).


## How can I build my own connector?

Cloud Studio offers two ways to build custom connectors:

-   [Connector Builder](/display/CS/Connector+Builder) is a no-code, UI-based tool to build connectors from REST
    APIs. Connector Builder connectors can be used immediately after creating them using either Cloud or Private
    Agents.

-   The [Connector SDK](https://developer.jitterbit.com/connector-sdk/) is a Java Software Development Kit to build
    connectors by writing Java code. Connector SDK connectors must be compiled and built and can be used only with
    Private Agents.


## What version of Cloud Studio am I using?

As a Harmony cloud application, you are always using the latest available version of Cloud Studio. If you want to
correlate the version with release notes, see [Finding My Jitterbit
Version](/display/DOC/Finding+My+Jitterbit+Version).

Like our desktop Design Studio application, Cloud Studio requires the use of [Harmony Agents](/display/DOC/Agent)
for running your projects. The minimum agent version supported with Cloud Studio is [version
9.4.2](/display/DOC/9.4).

Certain Cloud Studio features may require a higher agent version, including building custom connectors using the
[Connector Builder](/display/CS/Connector+Builder) or [Connector
SDK](https://developer.jitterbit.com/connector-sdk/) ([version 10.0](/display/DOC/10.0)) and using certain
application-specific connectors ([version 10.0](/display/DOC/10.0) or [10.1](/display/DOC/10.1)) as documented under
[Connectors](/display/CS/Connectors).

    <strong>NOTE:</strong> To use certain features, you may need to use a <a
    href="/display/DOC/Private+Agents">Private Agent</a> or the Jitterbit Sandbox Cloud Agent Group, as the
    Jitterbit Production Cloud Agent Group is on a later release cycle and may not include the latest available
    features (see <a href="/display/DOC/Cloud+Agent+Groups">Cloud Agent Groups</a>).

## How is Cloud Studio different from Design Studio?

When moving from [Design Studio](/display/DOC/Design+Studio) to Cloud Studio, you can review the main differences in
our [Cloud Studio Overview for Design Studio Users](/display/CS/Cloud+Studio+Overview+for+Design+Studio+Users).


## Can I migrate projects from Design Studio to Cloud Studio?

We offer a free evaluation for migration services. Migration cost could vary depending on project complexity. The
Jitterbit Cloud Studio Readiness Team can review your projects and provide an estimate. Your [Customer Success
Manager](mailto:success@jitterbit.com) can arrange a meeting with the Readiness Team.

You can also rebuild projects from scratch in Cloud Studio.


## What is the future of Design Studio?

We do not currently have plans to end-of-life or eliminate support for [Design Studio](/display/DOC/Design+Studio),
our existing desktop application for project design.


## Can I still use Cloud Studio if I want to keep using Design Studio for my current projects?

Sure! You can even use both Cloud Studio and Design Studio at the same time, as long as they are for ***different***
projects. Using both design applications for the same project is not possible.
